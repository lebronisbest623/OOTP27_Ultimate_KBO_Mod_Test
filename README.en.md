# OOTP27 KBO Launcher

OOTP27 does not natively support the Korean Baseball Organization ruleset. This project fills that gap.

The launcher starts or attaches to an OOTP27 process, prepares KBO data files, and injects a native patch DLL written in C. The native layer hooks the running game binary and applies KBO-specific rules at runtime without access to OOTP source code.

This project injects a native DLL into a running OOTP27 process and patches game memory and runtime behavior. OOTP updates, unsupported builds, local machine differences, antivirus/security policy, or unexpected save state may cause crashes, broken behavior, save corruption, or data loss.
